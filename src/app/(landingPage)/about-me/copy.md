# About Me

## Building Fast, SEO-Optimized Web Experiences with React & Next.js

I’m **Munim**, a frontend developer specializing in **React and Next.js**, focused on building **high-performance, SEO-friendly web applications** that help businesses grow — not just look good.

I combine **modern frontend engineering** with **SEO-aware architecture**, so the websites I build are fast, scalable, and discoverable by both search engines and AI platforms.

## My Journey into Web Development

I started my journey by building simple websites and learning how modern frontend frameworks work. As I worked on more real-world projects, I realized something important:**great design alone isn’t enough**.

Websites need to be:

- Fast
- Search-engine friendly
- Scalable for future growth

That realization pushed me deeper into **React**, **Next.js**, and **performance-focused development**. Over time, I began specializing in **SEO-optimized Next.js applications**, where frontend performance and visibility go hand in hand.

Today, I focus on building production-ready web applications that are engineered for **speed, maintainability, and long-term success**.

## What I Specialize In

I don’t try to do everything. I focus on areas where I can deliver real impact:

- **SEO-Optimized Next.js Websites**Built with server-side rendering, proper metadata, and clean architecture.
- **Custom React Interfaces**Scalable, reusable UI systems built with modern best practices.
- **Headless CMS Integration**Sanity, Strapi, or Contentful integrated cleanly with Next.js.
- **Performance & Core Web Vitals Optimization**Faster load times, better UX, and improved search visibility.

My focus is always on:

- Clean architecture
- Performance-first development
- SEO-aware frontend decisions
- Long-term scalability

## Beyond the Code

I believe great developers never stop learning.I regularly explore new tools, performance techniques, and modern frontend patterns — and I share my learnings through writing and experiments.

For me, web development is not just about code — it’s about **solving real problems with thoughtful engineering**.

## Notes for Design System

- Follow my existing desing/color system
- Desing should be both for light and dark mood
- Each ## heading = separate section
- Use generous spacing and container class (not full width)
- Mix text blocks with subtle visual separators
- Highlight “What I Specialize In” and “Process” sections
- CTA section should feel calm, confident, and clear
